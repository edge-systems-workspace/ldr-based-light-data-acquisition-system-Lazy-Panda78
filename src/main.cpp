 * @author Lazy-Panda78
 * @date 2026-02-19
 *
 * @details
 * This sketch reads analog brightness data from an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
 * connected to an analog input (A0). It prints the raw ADC reading and a
 * human-readable brightness status to the Serial Monitor every second.
 *
 * The program is intended as a simple data acquisition and monitoring demo
 * for educational and prototyping purposes.
